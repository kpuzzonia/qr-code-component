## My process

This project was a simple one to build. I was provided the QR picture and content by Frontend Mentor, along with an image of what the finished project should look like. 

My first step drawing a rough sketch of the different sections of the component. I then translated that iinto semantic HTML.

After making sure that the HTML was structured correctly, I applied styling. The font and color selections were provided to me. I played around until I was able to get the margins, padding, border-radius, etc. to my liking.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
